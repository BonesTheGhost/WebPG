This mobileFocus branch is for the sole purpose of testing a mobile first layout since the standard 'desktop resize to fit mobile' approach is proving to be a pain.

If this shows promise, maybe I will rethink about how the layout of the app should be approached, if not, no worries as my engineRebase branch does technically work and look pretty decent too.
